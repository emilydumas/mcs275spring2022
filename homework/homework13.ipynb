    "/divisors/of/7/\n",
    "/divisors/of/18/\n",
    "/divisors/of/832/\n",

    "Here, each N must of course be replaced by whatever integer is specified as part of the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running the app and then loading `http://localhost:5000/divisors/of/18/` in a browser (perhaps changing `5000` to the port number Flask reports it is using when it starts up) should produce a page looking something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can just iterate through all the integers `k` between 1 and `N` and check whether each one is a divisor of `N` or not.  This problem does not require you to use a more efficient method.\n",
