    "The Fibonacci sequence calculates the next term as the sum of the two previous terms.  Similarly, we can define a sequence $S_n$ where $S_0=0$, $S_1=1$, and where for $n>1$ the term $S_n$ is defined as the sum of the most recent \"half\" of the previous terms, rounding the number of summands *up* in case an odd number are present.  That is, $S_n$ is the sum of the terms $S_k$ as $k$ goes from $n//2$ to $n-1$.  You can check that the first 10 terms of this sequence ($S_0$ to $S_9$) are:\n",

    "A. Write a **memoized recursive function** `shop(n)` that takes a nonnegative integer `n` and returns $S_n$.  (The function name `shop` stands for **s**um **h**alf **o**f **p**revious.)\n",
