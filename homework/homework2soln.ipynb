    "\n",
    "Some cases to think about / test:\n",
    "* The first and last elements of a list have only one neighbor, so they are always either local minima or local maxima.\n",
    "* If all elements of the list are equal (e.g. `L = [275,275,275,275,275]`), then every element of the list is both a local maximum and a local minimum, and so the return value of `LEC` would be the length of the list.  (Don't check for this separately; it should be a consequence \n",
    "* If `L` has 0 or 1 elements, then there are no neighbors so the definition breaks down.  In these cases, just return `len(L)`.\n",
