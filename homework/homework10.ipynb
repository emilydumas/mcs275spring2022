    "Write a program that reads a color bitmap image (mode RGB) from a file, whose name is given as the first command line argument.  It should then create three image files, `red.png`, `green.png`, and `blue.png` of the same size as the input file.  Each of these should be a grayscale (mode L) image, with contents as follows:\n",
