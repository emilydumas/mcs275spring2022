    "## Problem 2: JSON key list\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a program `hwk9.py` that reads a JSON file specified as the first command line argument, and which prints a list of all the keys that appear in any of the nested objects in that file.  You can assume that JSON contains only numbers, strings, `null` (the JSON value that becomes Python's `None`), and objects (which Python converts to dictionaries); it will not contain any lists.\n",

    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"slinky\": {\n",
    "        \"green\": 11,\n",
    "        \"friend\": {\n",
    "            \"slinky\": 2,\n",
    "            \"graft\": 12.5\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        \"plus\": \"grand\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"present\": {\n",
    "        \"saucer\": \"orange\",\n",
    "        \"brand\": 97.5\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"nonce\": null\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the output might be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "slinky\n",
    "green\n",
    "friend\n",
    "graft\n",
    "plus\n",
    "present\n",
    "saucer\n",
    "brand\n",
    "nonce\n",
    "```\n",
    "It would be acceptable for the same list of keys to be printed in a different order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that even if a key is used in several places, it only appears once in the output list.  Since you only want to keep track of distinct keys, **make proper use of Python `set` object to keep track of the keys that have been seen.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you'll need to traverse the nested objects within the JSON file looking for keys, this problem is a natural candidate for recursion.  Keep in mind that if any value is a `dict`, then further recursion is needed to expore its keys.  If the value is not `dict`, then there is no need to search further."
