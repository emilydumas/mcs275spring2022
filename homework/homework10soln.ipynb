    "Write a program that reads a color bitmap image (mode RGB) from a file, whose name is given as the first command line argument.  It should then create three image files, `red.png`, `green.png`, and `blue.png` of the same size as the input file.  Each of these should be a grayscale (mode L) image, with contents as follows:\n",
    "* The brightness of the pixel at (x,y) in `red.png` is equal to the red component of the pixel (x,y) in the input file\n",
    "* The brightness of the pixel at (x,y) in `green.png` is equal to the green component of the pixel (x,y) in the input file\n",
    "* The brightness of the pixel at (x,y) in `blue.png` is equal to the blue component of the pixel (x,y) in the input file\n",
    "Thus, for example, if the pixel at (20,22) in the input file has color (8,220,91), then the pixel in `red.png` at (20,22) has brightness 8, the pixel in `green.png` at (20,22) has brightness 220, and the pixel in `blue.png` at (20,22) has brightness 91.\n",
