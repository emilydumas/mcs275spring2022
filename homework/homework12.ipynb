    "### The actual task\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the code above as a starting point, write a new program called `hwk12prob2.py` that examines files in the current directory and stores info about their last modified times and how often they've changed in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the program must do the following:\n",
    "* Open a SQLite database file called `lastmod.db`\n",
    "* Create a table called `files` as follows **if it doesn't already exist**:\n",
    "    * Column `name` of type TEXT (i.e. a Python string)\n",
    "    * Column `lastmod` of type INTEGER\n",
    "    * Column `revcount` of type INTEGER\n",
    "* Look at every file in the current directory, and do the following for each one:\n",
    "    * If the filename is `lastmod.db`, just continue to the next iteration of the loop (skipping everything below for this file)\n",
    "    * If there is **already a row** in the table `files` that has the same `name` as this file, then:\n",
    "        * Check whether the `lastmod` value for that row is equal to the last modified time of this file.\n",
    "            * If they are the same: Do nothing\n",
    "            * If they are different: Update the `lastmod` value for that row to the last modified time of this file, and also increase the value of `revcount` in that row by 1\n",
    "    * Otherwise (i.e. if there is **no row** in the table `files` that has the same `name` as this file):\n",
    "        * Create a new row in table `files` using this file's name as `name`, using its last modified time as `lastmod`, and setting `revcount` to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you run `hwk12prob2.py` in a given directory on a regular basis (say, every hour or every few minutes), it will notice every time a file has changed and keep a count of how many different versions it has seen thus far.  The database will also track the most recent modification time of every file, including any that have since been deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your program by running it in the directory where you're working on your assignment.  Make a modification to a file in that directory, and run `hwk12prob2.py` again.  Now if you open `lastmod.db` in the SQLite command line shell and run `SELECT * FROM files;` it should show all the files, most of which will have `revcount` equal to 1, but the file you modified should have `revcount` equal to 2."
