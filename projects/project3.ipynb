    "Binary search trees can use any **ordered** data type as a key.  It is only required that any two keys compare as either `>` or `<` or `==`.  This makes binary search trees suitable for storing a collection of integers, floats, or strings, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you wanted to make a tree where the keys are points in the 2-dimensional plane $(x,y)$?  There isn't a single preferred way to say that one point is \"less than\" another. Would you use the $x$ coordinate?  The $y$ coordinate?  Both, in some way?  Thus, while you *could* use a binary search tree, it isn't a perfect fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, there are a number of tree-based data structures that are specially adapted to storing points in the plane. In this project, you'll implement one of them."

    "First, let's discuss the geometric idea we'll use in place of the operators `<` and `>` that appear in binary search trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a 2-dimensional vector $V = (v_x,v_y)$ that is not the zero vector.  This is usually drawn as an arrow, like in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vector component diagram](images/vector.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a vector has an *angle* $\\theta$ that indicates how much you must rotate the positive x-axis in order for it to point in the same direction as $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vector angle diagram](images/angle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The angle can be measured in radians ($0 \\leq \\theta < 2 \\pi$) or in degrees ($0^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 360^\\circ$).  Note we use a convention where the angle is always positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we won't care so much about the exact angle of a vector, but will instead look at which *third* of the circle of directions it lies in.  We define:\n",
    "* Vector $V$ is in **sector 0** if its angle $\\theta$ satisfies $0 \\leq \\theta < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, or equivalently $0^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 120^\\circ$\n",
    "* Vector $V$ is in **sector 1** if its angle $\\theta$ satisfies $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\leq \\theta < \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$, or equivalently $120^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 240^\\circ$\n",
    "* Vector $V$ is in **sector 2** if its angle $\\theta$ satisfies $\\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$, or equivalently $240^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 360^\\circ$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the vectors in each sector 0,1,2 form a third of the plane.  These sectors are shown below.  Note that each sector is \"half open\": The boundary ray that is most clockwise for a given sector is part of the sector, the other boundary ray is not.  This is shown in the figure using color coding: The orange ray is part of the orange sector, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vector sectors](images/trisection_full.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you have a point $P$ that you think of as your current location, and another point $Q$ (not equal to $P$), you can form the vector $Q-P$ that describes the direction you must move from $P$ to get to $Q$.  Then, you can ask which sector the vector $Q-P$ lies in, and the answer can be thought of as indicating roughly where $Q$ sits relative to $P$.  Specifically, we define:\n",
    "* Point $Q$ is in **sector 0 of point $P$** if the vector $Q-P$ is in sector 0.\n",
    "* Point $Q$ is in **sector 1 of point $P$** if the vector $Q-P$ is in sector 1.\n",
    "* Point $Q$ is in **sector 2 of point $P$** if the vector $Q-P$ is in sector 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Notice we defined what it means for a vector to be in a sector earlier, and the new part here is that we're defining what it means for one point to lie in a sector **of another point**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So starting from any point $P$, you can classify the other point $Q$ as lying in sector 0, 1, or 2 of $P$.  This is analogous to the way you can start with a real number $x$ and classify another real number $y$ as lying to the right of $x$ or left of $x$.  Instead of having two possible answers about the relative position (left, right), we have three possible answers (sector 0, sector 1, sector 2).  We've chosen to divide the plane into three sectors, but of course a similar idea could be pursued for quarters of the plane, fifths of the plane, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "\n",
    "The sectors based at the point $P = (-2,1)$ are shown below.  In this diagram, you see that $Q=(1,1)$ and $R=(-1,2)$ lie in sector 0 of P, and $S=(-1,-1)$ lies in sector $2$ of $P$.\n",

    "\n",
    "You don't need to do any manual sector or angle calculations.  Instead, I've updated the module `plane` so that it can compute the sector or angle of a vector, and the sector of one point that contains another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the following methods have been added:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Vector2.angle()` - returns the angle of the vector, in radians.  If the vector is zero, raises `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Vector2.sector()` - returns an integer 0, 1, or 2, indicating which sector the vector lies in.  If the vector is zero, raises `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Point2.sector_of(Q)` - When called as a method of point `P`, and given an argument `Q`, returns the sector of the vector `Q-P`.  So `P.sector_of(Q)` returns 0, 1, or 2, depending on which sector of point `P` contains `Q`.\n",

    "## The data structure: Trisection Search Trees (TSTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trisection search tree** or **TST** is a data structure consisting of a tree of nodes.  Each node has a *key* which is a point in the plane (a `Point2` object from module `plane`).  Each node has three children, called *child 0*, *child 1*, and *child 2*, each of which is either another node or `None`.  The nodes in a TST are required to satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "* A node is only allowed to have key `None` if it is the only node in the entire tree; this represents an empty TST.\n",
    "* If a node $x$ has key $P$, then the keys of child 0 and its descendants are all in sector 0 of point $P$\n",
    "* If a node $x$ has key $P$, then the keys of child 1 and its descendants are all in sector 1 of point $P$\n",
    "* If a node $x$ has key $P$, then the keys of child 2 and its descendants are all in sector 2 of point $P$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when you move from a node to child $i$, you know that all the keys you see from now on will be in sector $i$ of the node you were previously on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a direct analogue of a binary search tree, but instead of \"left\" and \"right\" we have \"child 0\", \"child 1\", \"child 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concrete example.  Consider the following arrangement of points in the plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Points in the plane labeled P,Q,R,S,T](images/tst_example_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different TST structures that can store this set of points.  As with BST, the tree you get will depend on the insertion order of the points.  Here is an example of one such tree that you might get:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample TST](images/tst_example_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, edges indicate children, with a label showing the number of the child.  In the Python implementation you'll develop, the three children are stored in a list called `child`.  So an edge from a node `x` to a child `y` labeled `2` means that `y` would be equal to `x.child[2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is a possible TST for that set of points, first consider the sectors based at the root, $Q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example point set with sectors at Q](images/tst_example_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this diagram we see:\n",
    "* $S$ and $T$ lie in sector 0 of $Q$, so they must appear in the subtree of child 0 of $Q$\n",
    "* $P$ lies in sector 1 of $Q$, so $P$ must appear in the subtree of child 1 of $Q$\n",
    "* $R$ lies in sector 2 of $Q$, so $R$ must appear in the subtree of child 2 of $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree shown above chose to make $T$ the child 0 of $Q$, and to make $S$ a child of $T$.  To see which child of $T$ it should be, we can draw the sectors of $T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example point set with sectors at T](images/tst_example_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we're focused on nodes $S$ and $T$ right now, so the others are grayed out in this diagram.  We see that $S$ is in sector 1 of $T$, so $S$ must be child 1 of $T$ in this TST.  That agrees with what we see in the tree diagram above.  We have therefore checked that the tree shown above is a valid TST for this arrangement of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional topic: the region of a node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not required for this project but of possible interest.**  In this example, $S$ was child 1 of $T$ and $T$ was child 0 of $Q$.  What other points could be in that position?  The answer is the intersection of two sectors: Sector 1 of $T$ and sector 0 of $Q$.  This region is shaded in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Region of node S](images/tst_example_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, as you descend into a TST, the region that you know will contain all subsequent points shrinks (each time being intersected with a certain sector of another point).  This is similar to the way you gain more and more information about a node in a BST as you approach it from the root (e.g. it is larger than 5, less than 20, less than 18, larger than 16, ...). If you go deep enough into a TST (using an edge of each child type), the region of a node will become a bounded region, and in fact will be a hexagon!"
