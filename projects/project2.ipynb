    "\n",
    "### Splittings into distinct parts\n",

    "A splitting of an integer is said to have *distinct parts* if no two of the parts appearing in the splitting are equal.  For example, these are the splittings of 6 that have distinct parts:\n",
    "* 6\n",
    "* 5 + 1\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, a splitting of $n$ can use any positive integer between 1 and $n$.  But we could also decide on a smaller list of available summands.  For example, here are all the splittings of 6 where the only allowable summands are 2, 3, and 4:\n",

    "### Splittings with a limited set of parts that are also distinct\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the two ideas above, we could start with a list of distinct, allowable parts like 2,3,4,5,6 and ask for splittings of an integer into distinct parts from that list.  For example, the splittings of 6 into distinct parts from the list 2,3,4,5,6 are:\n",
    "* 6\n",
    "* 2 + 4\n",
    "* 4 + 2\n",

    "Notice that some of the allowed parts were never actually used; for example, the only way to write 6 as a sum of parts from the list 2,3,4,5,6 that includes 3 is the splitting 3+3, but that uses 3 twice, so it is not a splitting into distinct parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splittings with a limited number of parts\n",
