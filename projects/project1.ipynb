    "### Bacteria\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the object-oriented programming examples developed in lecture involves a series of simulated robots that move in the plane according to various rules.  This project is similar in spirit, but involves bacteria moving and reproducing in an environment.  Unlike the robot simulation example from lecture, the bacteria in this simulation need to consume resources from their environment, and so there is a separate class that manages these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment on which bacteria grow is modeled by a rectangular grid where each location is labeled by a pair of integers `(x,y)`.  The value of `x` indicates the column, and the value of `y` indicates the row, each starting at 0.  The coordinates of grid squares are shown below for a 6x4 grid, i.e. a grid with 6 columns and 4 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grid with coordinates](images/coords.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid square can be empty, or it can be occupied by a bacterium.  The environment keeps track of a list of the bacteria that currently live on it.  The picture below depicts a environment with a few bacteria (of three types, labeled \"D\", \"E\", and \"F\").  Each of these bacteria would have a corresponding object that manages its behavior (and you will write the classes that do this).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bacteria on the grid](images/occupied-cells.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each grid square also contains a certain quantity of nutrients.  The quantity is an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive).  The nutrient quantity is an abstraction of all the resources a bacterium absorbs from its environment.  The behavior of a bacterium in the environment will depend on the available nutrients.  In the image below, an example distribution of nutrients is shown by coloring squares in shades of gray, with white meaning no nutrients at all, and progressively darker shades of gray indicating cells with larger quantities of nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nutrient densities](images/nutrients.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `environments.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `environments.py` from the starter pack contains a class `Environment` that represents an environment of the type described above.  It manages the list of bacteria that are present, and the quantity of nutrients in each grid square.  Initially, every square has the same quantity of nutrients.  An environment is created as\n",

    "```\n",

    "An environment with a uniform distribution of nutrients is not so interesting, so this file also contains some subclasses that do more interesting things:\n",
    "* `HillEnvironment` - an environment where the middle is nutrient-rich, while the edges have a low nutrient density\n",
    "* `GradientEnvironment` - an environment with more nutrients near the bottom (larger y coordinate), less near the top (smaller y coordinate).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `bacteria.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains just one class, `Bacterium`.  It represents a bacterium that lives in an environment.  The environment must already exist, and is given as an argument to the constructor of `Bacterium`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bacterium` class takes an initial position, adds itself to the environment, and then just sits there doing nothing.  The point of this project is to make subclasses that represent bacteria with more interesting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, you are going to build these subclasses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Eater` - A bacterium that consumes nutrients at its location until they are exhausted, then moves to a neighbhoring grid square that contains nutrients.  If no such neighboring square exists, it dies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Floater` - A bacterium that always tries to decrease its y coordinate by moving up one row.  If it can't do that, it consumes one unit of nutrients.  If neither of those things is possible, it dies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Divider` - A bacterium that can't move, but which can reproduce if conditions are right (plenty of nutrients and available space).  If it can't reproduce, it eats.  If it can't do either of those things, it dies.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* The methods you add to subclasses of `Bacterium` should only call other methods of the `Bacterium` class and build-in Python functions.  It should not be necessary to call methods of `Environment` directly, as the `Bacterium` class provides everything you need to interact with the environment (e.g. `move()`, `nutrients_available()`, `consume()`, and `die()`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Does the Python interpreter accept the contents of `bacteria.py` as valid Python code?  (**5 points**)\n",
    "1. Does `bacteria.py` contain docstrings for all classes, functions, and methods? (**5 points**)\n",
    "1. Can `bacteria.py` be imported without raising an exception, in a directory containing the `environments.py` and `plane.py` files from the starter pack? (**5 points**)\n",

    "1. Functional tests: Do the classes `Eater`, `Floater`, and `Divider` behave as specified when placed in environments and simulated?  (several test cases totaling **24 points**)\n",

    "### Manual review: 10 points\n",

    "I will review your code and look for adherence to the coding standards and other rules given above, and I will examine your method of solving the problem.  If I see that your program does not do what was requested in this document, but the error was not detected in the automated testing, a deduction may be given at this point.  The scores assigned by the autograder will not be changed during manual review unless I discover some kind of intentional wrongdoing (such as an attempt to circumvent or reverse-engineer the autograder's operation)."

Every time you create a new bacterium class, add an instance of it to `textsimulation.py` and try it out.
