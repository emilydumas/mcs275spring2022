    "### 1. Learn a little more about `maze.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves reading and learning more about the module `maze` we discussed in Lecture 15.  You'll use the things you learn about here in subsequent problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 15 we discussed a minimal way of using the module:\n",
    "* Create a `Maze` object (e.g. with `M = maze.Maze(xsize=7,ysize=7)`\n",
    "* Set some squares to blocked (using `M.set_blocked` for individual squares, and/or `M.apply_border` which makes all of the edge squares blocked)\n",
    "* Set the start and goal (`M.start` and `M.goal`) locations\n",
    "* Use a recursive backtracking function to find a path from the start to the goal\n",
    "The function created in the last step can be found in [solvemaze.py](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs275spring2021/blob/master/samplecode/recursion/solvemaze.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `maze` has several other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as SVG file\n",
    "\n",
    "`Maze` objects have a method `save_svg(filename)` that writes a graphical representation of the maze to a file in the SVG format.  This is a vector graphics format (scalable, not pixel-based) that can be viewed in most web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method also accepts an optional argument `highlight`, which if given should be a list of `(x,y)` pairs that indicate squares in the maze that should be higlighted in light blue.  For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "mymaze.save_svg(\"cool.svg\",highlight=[ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "will save the maze to `cool.svg`, and highlight three squares in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `highlight` argument is provided as a way to indicate the solution of a maze, or any other feature you might choose to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as a PNG file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this feature, you need to install a module that isn't in Python's standard library.  The module `PIL` is from a package called *Pillow*, and is used to work with image files.  The following command should install it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Pillow, you can save a maze object as a PNG file (a bitmap graphics format supported by nearly every program that deals with images) using the `save_png` method.  Its arguments are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "save_png(filename,scale=1,highlight=[])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The argument `scale` is a positive integer controlling the width of each maze square in pixels.  The default, `scale=1`, will result in a tiny image file where each pixel is a maze square.  To get a reasonable size output image, try `scale=10` or `scale=30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PrimRandomMaze` inherits from `Maze` and automatically generates a random maze that has exactly one path from the start to the goal.  Its constructor takes only two arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PrimRandomMaze(xsize,ysize)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and both `xsize` and `ysize` must be **odd** numbers.  This random maze generator uses [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), which is known for producing mazes of moderate difficulty, with many short dead ends."

What about short lists?\n",
