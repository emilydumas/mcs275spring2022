It provides a Windows 10 computer that you can control through a web browser.  However, remote desktop systems like this don't feel as fast, responsive, or natural as using things installed locally.  I think you will have a better experience if you can install the software necessary to develop programs on your own device.  (For example, many common keyboard shortcuts don't work in the virtual lab.)\n",
