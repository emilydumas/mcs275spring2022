    "Given a node `x` in a BST, you might want to know its **successor**, meaning the node whose key is larger than `x` but as small as possible given that condition.  (We'll assume in this problem that all nodes in the tree have distinct keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is an efficient description of the successor as follows:\n",
    "* If `x` has a right child, then the successor is the smallest key in the right subtree of `x`\n",
    "* If `x` does not have a right child, but has a successor, then the successor is an ancestor of `x`.  If you visit these ancestors by traveling upward from `x`, then the first node you reach that is the left child of its parent is the successor.\n",
    "* If `x` has no right child, and if moving up from `x` to the root only ever visits nodes that are right children of their parents, then `x` is the maximum of the tree, so it has no successor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a method `successor` of class `BST` that finds and returns the successor of a node, or returns `None` if there is no successor."
