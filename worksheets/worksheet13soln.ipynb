    "### A Flask feature\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's discuss a feature of Flask that didn't come up in Lecture 35, but will be useful in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that if `app` is a `flask.Flask` object, then the decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route(\"/orthogonal/sauntering/balloon/\")\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    return \"...HTML HERE...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "will arrange that the function `f` gets called whenever the document `/orthogonal/sauntering/balloon` is requested from the application (e.g. by you opening `http://localhost:8000/orthogonal/sauntering/balloon/` in a web browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is great for fixed URLs, but sometimes you want many similar URLs to all be handled by a single function.  Typically, the function would look at certain parts of the URL to decide what to do.  For example, in an application that has pages with information about planets, you could define separate functions for each of\n",
    "```\n",
    "/orbital_period/venus/\n",
    "/orbital_period/earth/\n",
    "/orbital_period/mars/\n",
    "```\n",
    "but it would be nicer to have a single function that can return a page about the orbital period for any of the planets.  Flask supports this with a syntax like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route(\"/orbital_period/<planet>/\")  # part inside < and > brackets is a placeholder\n",
    "def get_period(planet):     # the string appearing there gets passed as an argument\n",
    "    return \"...HTML HERE...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "so that a request for `/orbital_period/earth/` will call `get_period(\"earth\")` while a request for `/orbit_period/mars/` will call `get_period(\"mars\")`.  Note that the parameters of the function need to match the names given inside the `<...>` appearing in the route description (e.g. `<planet>` in the route description means we need a parameter called `planet`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Flask application `baseconvert.py` that can convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal, based on a request encoded as a URL such as\n",
    "```\n",
    "/decimal/120/to/binary/\n",
    "/binary/1001/to/hexadecimal/\n",
    "/hexadecimal/f00f/to/decimal/\n",
    "```\n",
    "with the general syntax being \n",
    "```\n",
    "/INBASE/N/to/OUTBASE/\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `INBASE` and `OUTBASE` are each one of `decimal`, `binary`, or `hexadecimal`, and where `N` is a sequence of digits representing an integer in the number system `INBASE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application should only have a single route which decides what to do based on parts of the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for example, a request for `/decimal/9/to/binary/` might generate this HTML code as a response:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!doctype HTML>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "<title>Decimal 9 is binary 1001</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "<h1>9 = 0b1001</h1>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "and for `/hexadecimal/1f/to/decimal/`, the HTML your application sends as the response might be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!doctype HTML>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "<title>Hexadecimal 1f is decimal 31</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
