    "### Get the SQLite command line shell\n",
    "\n",
    "There's nothing to install if you just want to use SQLite with Python, as the module `sqlite3` is already part of the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you just want to run one SQL query and show the results, a fairly long Python program is needed.  It's much easier if you can install the SQLite REPL (or \"command line shell\") that lets you run queries directly from a prompt in your terminal.  This worksheet assumes you have the command line shell for SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lectures 30 and 32 discussed how to install this.   Here is a quick video showing the steps to install in Windows 10:\n",
    "* [Windows 10 installation of SQLite command line shell](https://youtu.be/6chDaT7yMl0)  <--- **WATCH THIS IF YOU USE WINDOWS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are more detailed written installation instructions by platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you use **Windows**, you need to install it yourself.  The installation doesn't look like the graphical ones you may be used to, with a window and buttons guiding you through the steps.  Instead you download a zip file and extract it.  The whole thing is relatively quick, but the steps below are described in some detail, so the written instructions are a bit long.  (Consider just [watching the 1-minute video](https://youtu.be/6chDaT7yMl0) and following along instead.)\n",
    "    1. Go to [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).\n",
    "    1. Scroll down to the heading **Precompiled Binaries for Windows**\n",
    "    1. In that section, click on the link whose name begins with `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-`.  The description next to the link should begin: *A bundle of command-line tools for managing SQLite database files*\n",
    "    1. The download should either begin immediately, or you'll be asked if you want to download the file.  If prompted, save it somewhere you know how to find in the file explorer.\n",
    "    1. Find the ZIP file you just downloaded and open it in the file explorer (either by clicking the filename where the web browser shows a recent download, or by opening the file explorer and navigating to the place where you saved the ZIP file).\n",
    "    1. This should open a new explorer window in which you browse the contents of the ZIP file.  It contains a folder with a name like `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3380200`.  Double click to enter that folder.\n",
    "    1. You should now see a list of three files, named\n",
    "        * `sqldiff.exe`\n",
    "        * `sqlite3.exe`\n",
    "        * `sqlite3_analyzer.exe`\n",
    "        \n",
    "       However, the `.exe` may be missing if explorer is configured to hide file extensions (the default).\n",
    "    1. Of these, `sqlite3.exe` is the only one you want.  Drag that file to the desktop to extract a copy of it.\n",
    "    1. You should now see a `sqlite3` icon on the desktop.  Don't click it; we'll work in the terminal instead.\n",
    "    1. Open a terminal (Windows Terminal or PowerShell) and change directory to the desktop (e.g. with `cd Desktop` or `cd C:\\Users\\myusername\\Desktop` or `cd C:\\Users\\myusername\\OneDrive\\Desktop`, depding on where PowerShell opens and whether you use OneDrive desktop backup)\n",
    "    1. Test running the command line shell by entering this command in powershell: `.\\sqlite3.exe`\n",
    "    1. Now SQLite should display a startup message and prompt.  **Success!**\n",
    "    1. Exit the SQLite command line shell with `.exit` to return to PowerShell\n",
    "    1. In the future, you will probably want to run the SQLite command line shell from whatever directory contains your database file.  To do that, open PowerShell, go to the directory you want to work in, and then enter the full path to the `sqlite3.exe` file, e.g. `C:\\Users\\myusername\\Desktop\\sqlite3.exe`.\n",
    "        * If your username contains spaces, this won't work.  You will need to instead surround the command with single quotation marks and precede it with an ampersand and space, e.g.\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        & 'C:\\Users\\My Username Has Spaces\\Desktop\\sqlite3.exe'\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you use **Linux** or **MacOS**, SQLite's command line shell is almost always pre-installed.  Type `sqlite3` in a terminal and press enter.  Success (meaning it is already installed) looks something like this:\n",

    "### Know how to tell which REPL is open, and how to exit SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time you have your terminal open, there are three situations you may find yourself in:\n",
    "1. The terminal itself is waiting for a command from you.  If this is the case, you'll see a prompt like\n",

    "### Expressions in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a new SQLite feature (or more precisely, a feature of the SQL dialect that SQLite uses for queries) that you'll need to use in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many places where we've used column names in our queries, you can also use expressions that apply arithmetic operators and other functions to the values in the columns.  For example, if a database of MCS 275 grades has columns called `project3pct` and `project4pct`, then this query would return the email addresses of students whose grades on those two projects differed by more than 10 percent:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT email FROM mcs275roster WHERE ABS(project3pct - project4pct) > 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also use expressions like this in the requested list of output columns.  For example, this query would get the average of project 3 and 4 percentages for all students, listed in alphabetical order by last name.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT lastname, firstname, 0.5*(project3pct + project4pct) FROM mcs275roster ORDER BY lastname;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Such expressions can also be used after `ORDER BY` to make a custom sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find lists of built-in functions in SQLite in the documentation:\n",
    "* [SQL core functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html)\n",
    "* [SQL math functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that stores, delivers, and ranks programming jokes using a SQLite database.  It should support three operations:\n",
    "* Add a joke: The user provides a string and the program adds it to the joke table.  In addition to the joke itself, the joke table has columns to store the number of times a joke has been told, and how many times it was successful in amusing the user.\n",
    "* Tell a joke: A random joke is selected and displayed.  The user is asked if they found it amusing.  Their answer is recorded by updating the relevant counts (times told, times successful) for that row.\n",
    "* Best jokes list:  Among jokes that have succeeded at least once, display the top 5 ranked by success rate (ratio of times successful to times told).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should create the database and table it needs if they don't already exist.  Otherwise, it should open and use the existing database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three functions should be selected using command line arguments.  The first command line argument is always the command---one of `add`, `tell`, or `best`.  If the command is `add`, then a second command line argument is required, which is the joke itself.  If the command is `tell`, no other arguments are required but the user is prompted for their approval/disapproval of the joke through keyboard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "1. Even without you asking to do so, SQLite will add an extra column to your table called `rowid` that has a distinct integer value for each row.  This is a *primary key*.  It won't return this column unless you ask for it explicitly (e.g. `SELECT * FROM ...` won't show it, but `SELECT rowid FROM ...` or `SELECT rowid,* FROM ...` will.  Having a unique id for each row is helpful so you can retrieve a row, and then apply an operation to the same row later.\n",
    "1. SQLite doesn't have a feature to select a random row directly, but it does have a built-in function `RANDOM()` that will return a random number for each row, and you order by that.\n",
    "1. In a SQLite query, if columns `A` and `B` both have type integer then `A/B` computes the *integer* division of `A` by `B`.  In contrast, `1.0*A/B` would give the true quotient because the multiplication by 1.0 converts `A` to a float (or `REAL`, in SQLite terminology).\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the program as `jokedb.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample session of what using it should look like. (These are from a linux terminal session, where the terminal prompt is \"$\".  In Windows PowerShell, the prompt will look a bit different.)"
