    "An integer greater than 1 is called **prime** if its only divisors are 1 and itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every positive integer other than 1 is a product of primes, and that the description as a product of primes is unique up to reordering the factors.  For example, $275$ can be expressed as $5\\times5\\times11$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a recursive function `factor(n)` that takes an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a list of primes whose product is equal to `n`.  That is, `factor(n)` returns the *prime factorization* of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend the following strategy: Try to find a way to express `n` as a product of two other integers greater than 1.  If you fail, you know that `n` is prime.  If you succeed, you the have `n = k * m` and so it would be enough to know the prime factorization of `k` and of `m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: One way to check whether `k` divides `n`, is to check whether the remainder `n%k` is zero.\n",
