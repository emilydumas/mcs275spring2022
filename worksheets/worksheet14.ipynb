    "\n",
    "Download and extract this zip file which contains a partially-written Flask web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [speakerslate.zip](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2022/spring/mcs275/nbview/worksheets/speakerslate.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the application provides:\n",
    "* All the HTML templates it requires\n",
    "* All the CSS it requires\n",
    "* Most of the Python code:  A Flask application is provided that is just missing two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read below for an explanation of what the app is *meant to do*, and what part is missing.  Then, add the missing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application concept\n",
    "\n",
    "*SpeakerSlate* is an application allowing speakers who have been invited to a conference to choose their speaking times on a first-come first-served basis.  Initially, all of the conference's speaking times are open.  As speakers visit the site and reserve their times, their choices are recorded in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, a SQLite database stores rows representing the speaking slots at the conference, containing columns for the datetime (e.g. `\"Saturday 9am\"`), the speaker (`NULL` if this slot is available, or a name like `\"Emily Dumas\"` if it has been assigned), and an integer `slotid` that uniquely identifies the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to providing a way for speakers to choose a speaking time, the application also lets anyone view a list of lectures that have been scheduled.  There is also a feature meant for administrators that will delete all existing lecture time assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual tour\n",
    "\n",
    "* The application's main page `/` is rendered from `templates/front.html`.  It is generated by a function `front()` in `speakerslate.py`.  It looks like this:\n",
    "![front page](images/ws14-ss-front.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to choose a lecture time goes to `/userinfo/` which results in the form shown below, rendered from `templates/userinfo.html`.  It is generated by a function `userinfo()` in `speakerslate.py`.\n",
    "![userinfo form](images/ws14-ss-userinfo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the user information form is submitted, it posts its data to `/choose/` which must be rendered from `templates/choose.html` after making a SQL query to determine what speaking slots are available.  **The HTML template is provided, but you must write the associated function `showchoices()` in `speakerslate.py`.**\n",
    "![speaking slot choices](images/ws14-ss-choose.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The links in the speaking slot choice page go to URLs like `/assign/6/to/David/` (meaning: Assign `slotid` 6 to speaker `David`).  **You must write the associated function `assign_slot_to_person(slotid,username)` in `speakerslate.py`.**  This function performs an action, but then redirects the browser to the schedule page (`/schedule/`).  Thus, while you'll need to write some code, this route will not involve rendering any template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The schedule page at `/schedule/` is available in two ways:  It is linked directly from the front page, and it is the destination the browser is redirected to after a speaker chooses their time.  It is rendered from `templates/schedule.html`. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![schedule](images/ws14-ss-schedule.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "First, try running the application `speakerslate.py` in its current form.  See what works and what doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, take a look at the code in `speakerslate.py`.  Look at the existing routes and try to understand how they work.  The function for `/schedule/` will probably be especially helpful, as it is quite similar to `/choose/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the database reset code for information about the table and column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read template `templates/choose.html`, since this is going to be rendered by a function you write.**  Determine what variables it uses, and what values they are supposed to contain.  Design database queries to retrieve those values."
