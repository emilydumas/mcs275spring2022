One of the easiest and most flexible is to use HTML-style hex colors, in the format `\"#C0FFEE\"`.  Here, the six hex digits split into pairs to give the red, green, and blue components, which in this case are `0xC0 = 192` red, `0xFF = 255` green, and `0xEE = 238` blue.  You can use an [online color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) to choose a color visually and see the hex codes.\n",

    "In case diplomacy fails, you have been asked to make a scatter plot to visualize the data in the table and help with planning a defense.

(Scale the sizes so the dots are large but do not overlap.)\n",

Then, learn about `plt.annotate` from the matplotlib documentation and use to add text labels to all the points where the \"danger level\" (defined as the product of hostility and readiness) is bigger than 3000.  Finally, adjust the way the scatter plot is drawn so that these points with high danger level are shown in a different color (e.g. red).\n",
    "\n",
    "While I suggest getting the plot working in a notebook, when you have it finalized, make it into a script that doesn't display the figure at all, but instead saves it as both a PNG image and a PDF document.

    "In lecture we created and discussed a notebook to make primitive pictures of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials $f(z) = z^2 + c$ for different values of c.  The pictures we made show a region in the complex plane, with black pixels at points $a$ where the sequence $a, f(a), f(f(a)), ...$ remains inside some disk $|z|<R$ (for all the iterations tested) and white pixels where the sequence leaves that disk.  In our pictures we used $R=2$ and took several values of $c$.\n",

    "These pictures are interesting, but they throw away a lot of useful information:  Sometimes a point takes many iterations to leave the disk $|z|<R$, while other points leave the disk quickly.  That is, points that \"escape to infinity\" don't all do so at the same rate.\n",
