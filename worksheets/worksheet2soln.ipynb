    "Suppose you have a list of integers.  Even if the list is not entirely in increasing order, there are sometimes *parts* of the list that are in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider `L = [1,21,4,17,39,35,22,0,6,2,5]`. The list is not in increasing order, but the first two elements (i.e. `L[0:2]` or `[1,21]`) are in increasing order.  Also, if you take the slice `L[2:6]`, which is `[4,17,38,39]`, that is in increasing order.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function `IRL(L)` that takes a list `L` whose elements can be compared to one another (e.g. a mix of integers and floats, or a collection of strings) and returns the length of the longest increasing run within `L`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special cases (not necessarily requiring special handling, but explained here to clarify the extremes):\n",
    "* If `L` is empty, the function should return 0\n",
    "* If `L` is in decreasing order, the function should return 1 because a slice with one element can be considered to be in \"increasing order\", and that would be the longest increasing run.\n",

The number of steps it takes to do this is called the **recurrence time**.  It's possible that this may never happen, but that is very unlikely.  (It can be shown that the probability it will eventually return to `(0,0)` is 100%.)\n",

The program should then print a table showing how many times each recurrence time was seen (a *histogram*).  Here's an example of what it might look like:"
