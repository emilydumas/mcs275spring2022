    "\n",
    "Write a program to merge any number of CSV files, so that each row in any of the input files becomes a row in the output file.  All of the input CSV files will have header rows.  If the CSV files have the same columns, this is of course easy.  But you should also handle the general case, where some columns may exist in multiple files, and others may be unique to a single file.  The output file should contain one column for each distinct column name that appears in any of the input files.\n",
