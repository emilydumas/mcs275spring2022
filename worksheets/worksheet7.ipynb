    "### 1. Learn a little more about `maze.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves reading and learning more about the module `maze` we discussed in Lecture 15.  You'll use the things you learn about here in subsequent problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 15 we discussed a minimal way of using the module:\n",
    "* Create a `Maze` object (e.g. with `M = maze.Maze(xsize=7,ysize=7)`\n",
    "* Set some squares to blocked (using `M.set_blocked` for individual squares, and/or `M.apply_border` which makes all of the edge squares blocked)\n",
    "* Set the start and goal (`M.start` and `M.goal`) locations\n",
    "* Use a recursive backtracking function to find a path from the start to the goal\n",
    "The function created in the last step can be found in [solvemaze.py](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs275spring2021/blob/master/samplecode/recursion/solvemaze.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `maze` has several other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as SVG file\n",
    "\n",
    "`Maze` objects have a method `save_svg(filename)` that writes a graphical representation of the maze to a file in the SVG format.  This is a vector graphics format (scalable, not pixel-based) that can be viewed in most web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method also accepts an optional argument `highlight`, which if given should be a list of `(x,y)` pairs that indicate squares in the maze that should be higlighted in light blue.  For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "mymaze.save_svg(\"cool.svg\",highlight=[ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "will save the maze to `cool.svg`, and highlight three squares in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `highlight` argument is provided as a way to indicate the solution of a maze, or any other feature you might choose to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as a PNG file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this feature, you need to install a module that isn't in Python's standard library.  The module `PIL` is from a package called *Pillow*, and is used to work with image files.  The following command should install it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Pillow, you can save a maze object as a PNG file (a bitmap graphics format supported by nearly every program that deals with images) using the `save_png` method.  Its arguments are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "save_png(filename,scale=1,highlight=[])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The argument `scale` is a positive integer controlling the width of each maze square in pixels.  The default, `scale=1`, will result in a tiny image file where each pixel is a maze square.  To get a reasonable size output image, try `scale=10` or `scale=30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PrimRandomMaze` inherits from `Maze` and automatically generates a random maze that has exactly one path from the start to the goal.  Its constructor takes only two arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PrimRandomMaze(xsize,ysize)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and both `xsize` and `ysize` must be **odd** numbers.  This random maze generator uses [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), which is known for producing mazes of moderate difficulty, with many short dead ends."

    "\n",
    "Add a new function `solvemaze_history()` to `solvemaze.py` that works similarly to `solvemaze()` but which returns a list of every path considered (rather than just a single path that is a solution).  Thus the last item in the returned list will be a solution, if a solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write a script that uses `solvemaze_history` to do the following:\n",
    "* Take a command line argument, an odd integer `n`\n",
    "* Generate a random `n` by `n` maze\n",
    "* Solve the maze, keeping track of the history of paths considered\n",

    "### 4. Simple custom mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the `PrimRandomMaze` class to generate a maze, write your own subclass of `Maze` that creates a maze in which `start` and `goal` are set, the border is fully blocked, and so that it is possible to get from `start` to `goal`.  The constructor should create some obstacles between the start and goal, to make the maze more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might make a class that simply places a large rectangle of blocked squares in the middle of the maze, so that a solution must either go along the top and right, or bottom and left.  Or you might make some walls coming out of the sides, so that a solution needs to turn back and forth several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristics you are looking for are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability to generate a maze of a given size (specified as arguments to the constructor)\n",
    "* Certainty that the maze always has a solution\n",
    "\n",
    "It's OK for the constructor to decide a size is too small or is otherwise unacceptable, and raise an exception.  But to keep things interesting, it *should* allow arbitrarily large mazes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script that instantiates your class and then uses `solvemaze` to find a solution.  Save the solved maze to a SVG file."

    "### 5. Merge sorted stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a *stack* is a data structure that mimics a physical stack of items, where the only available operations are to remove the top item (`pop`) or add a new item to the top (`push`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can simulate a stack using a list by limiting yourself to only calling the methods\n",

    "* `.append(x)` for the stack push operation\n",
    "In this way, the end of the list becomes the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mergesort, the main step was to create a function that can merge two sorted lists.  We made a version of this that uses indexing by integers.  However, the algorithm for merging two sorted lists only ever needs to look at the \"next\" item from each of the lists, meaning it can also be implemented using stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a function `merge_sorted_stacks(A,B,S)` that takes two stacks `A` and `B` whose elements are in sorted order, with the top of each stack being the smallest element, and an initially empty stack `S`.  The function should merge the two stacks into a single reverse-sorted stack `S`.  It can destroy `A` and `B` as it does so.\n",
